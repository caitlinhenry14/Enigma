# Enigma
Enigma machine simulator in Java

Simulation of the infamous Enigma machine invented by Arthur Scherbius and notably used by the German Military during WW2. All the information I used to understand the workings of the machine and translate that into code came from YouTube videos by Jared Owen and Numberphile. 

To run the app, download the code as a ZIP file, download Processing, open the code, and press start (hopefully it works...).
