# Enigma
A simulation of the infamous Enigma machine invented by Arthur Scherbius and notably used by the German Military during WW2. All the information I used to understand the workings of the machine and translate that into code came from YouTube videos by [Jared Owen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybkkiGtJmkM) and [Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2_Q9FoD-oQ). 

To run the app, clone the repository, download [Processing](https://processing.org/download), open the code, and press start (hopefully it works...).
